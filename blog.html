            <p>Blogs are a type of regularly updated websites that provide insight into a certain topic. The word blog
                is a combined version of the words “web” and “log.” At their inception, blogs were simply an online
                diary where people could keep a log about their daily lives on the web. They have since morphed into an
                essential forum for individuals and businesses alike to share information and updates. In fact, many
                people even make money blogging as professional full-time bloggers. <br>
                <br>

                As the publishing world has evolved, and more of it has moved online, blogs have come to occupy a
                central position in this digital content world. Blogs are a source of knowledge, opinion and concrete
                advice. While not yet posed to replace journalism as an art form, people increasingly look to trusted
                blogs to find answers to their questions, or to learn how to do something. <br>
                <br>

                Blogs are always evolving both in terms of how they're created and what they are used for. They can be a
                vehicle for creativity and for marketing. They're also increasingly created and read on mobile apps, as
                mobile blogging also comes into its own. <br>
